## How to Use the AI Estimating Assistant

The AI Assistant allows you to speak naturally to add, update, delete, or query line items in your estimate. No need for rigid formatting!

### Opening the AI Assistant

1. **Click the purple "AI Assistant" button** in the top-right header, OR
2. **Click the purple floating button** in the bottom-right corner (with sparkles icon ✨)

### Using Voice Commands

Once the chat window opens, you can either:
- **Click the microphone icon** to speak your command
- **Type your command** in the text box and press Enter

### Example Commands

#### Creating New Lines

```
"Add a column W12x14, 5 pieces, 20 feet each"
"Create a new beam, W10x15, 3 pieces, 15 feet"
"Add HSS 6x6x1/4, 10 pieces, 30 feet"
"Add a plate, 1/2 inch thick, 48 by 96, 2 pieces"
```

#### Updating Existing Lines

```
"Update line 3, change quantity to 6"
"Change L2 to 25 feet"
"Make line 5 grade A572"
"Update line 4, change the size to W14x22"
```

#### Deleting Lines

```
"Delete line 5"
"Remove L3"
"Delete line 2"
```

#### Querying Information

```
"What's on line 2?"
"Show me all columns"
"What's the total weight?"
"List all beams"
```

### How It Works

1. **Speak or type** your command naturally
2. **AI processes** your command and understands the intent
3. **AI maps** the information to the correct database fields
4. **System executes** the action (create, update, delete, or query)
5. **AI responds** with confirmation

### Tips

- **Be natural**: Speak as you would to a colleague
- **Include line IDs**: When updating/deleting, mention the line number (e.g., "line 3", "L2")
- **Specify quantities**: Include how many pieces you need
- **Mention dimensions**: Include lengths, sizes, grades, etc.
- **Ask questions**: The AI can tell you what's on any line

### Differences from Regular Voice Input

- **Regular Voice Input** (blue): Requires structured format with field names
- **AI Assistant** (purple): Understands natural language - just speak normally!

### Troubleshooting

- **Not understanding?** Try rephrasing or being more specific
- **Wrong field?** The AI learns from context - try again with more details
- **No response?** Check your microphone permissions and internet connection

Enjoy the power of natural language estimating! 🚀
