# Landing Page Improvements - UI/UX & Steel Estimator Analysis

## Missing Critical Elements

### From UI/UX Designer Perspective:
1. **Primary Action Missing**: "New Project" button should be the most prominent CTA
2. **No Context/Personalization**: Missing user info, recent activity, or quick stats
3. **Poor Visual Hierarchy**: All buttons have equal weight, no clear entry point
4. **No Project List**: Estimators need to see their active projects immediately
5. **Missing Quick Actions**: No shortcuts for common workflows
6. **No Search**: Can't quickly find existing projects
7. **No Status Indicators**: No way to see what needs attention
8. **Missing Onboarding**: First-time users need guidance

### From Steel Estimator Perspective:
1. **Bid Calendar**: Need to see upcoming bid deadlines at a glance
2. **Project Status**: Active, Draft, Submitted, Won/Lost status
3. **Recent Projects**: Quick access to recently worked on estimates
4. **Project Templates**: Quick start from common project types
5. **Material Pricing**: Quick lookup for current steel prices
6. **Import/Export**: Quick access to CSV import/PDF export
7. **AI Usage Dashboard**: Show current month's AI costs upfront
8. **Priority Sorting**: Projects sorted by bid date urgency
